# 2-dof-Haptic-Joystick-Tennis-game


This project presents a novel two-degree-of-freedom
(2-DoF) joystick designed for virtual racket sports that integrates haptic feedback to mimic realistic physical sensations.
The device incorporates two DC motors capable of generating
directional force feedback, simulating ball impact, textured
surfaces, and collision boundaries. A pilot study involving six
participants was conducted to evaluate the effect of haptic
feedback on user performance and experience in a virtual tennis
environment.
